# Tic Tac Toe Game

## Bugs Fixed

- **Player Turn Display:** Fixed an issue where the player's turn display was showing the function definition instead of the actual message. The status now correctly updates to show "Player X's Turn" or "Player O's Turn".
- **Restart Button:** Added a missing event listener to the restart button so the game can be restarted without refreshing the page.
- **Winner Highlight Reset:** Ensured that the winning cell highlighting is cleared when the game is restarted.
- **Player Symbol Coloring:** Added logic to color the X and O symbols differently for better visual distinction.

## Improvements Made

- **Modern UI:** Updated the CSS for a modern, clean look using the Poppins font, improved color scheme, and subtle box-shadows.
- **Game Over Styling:** Enhanced the status message to visually indicate when the game is over (win or draw).
- **Responsive Design:** Improved layout and sizing for better appearance on different screen sizes.
- **Code Cleanliness:** Improved code readability and maintainability by organizing logic and using best practices.

Enjoy playing Tic Tac Toe!
